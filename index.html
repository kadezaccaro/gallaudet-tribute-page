          In 1864, Gallaudet University (pictured above) was founded and named
          after Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, a notable figure in the advancement of
          deaf education. The first American school for the deaf was established
          in 1817 by<strong> Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet</strong> and
          <strong>Laurent Clerc</strong>.

              Dr. Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet is probably the most influential
              person in the history of American Sign Language. Gallaudet, along
              with Laurent Clerc, was responsible for starting the first free
              public school for the deaf in the United States.
